# AI Product Advisor - React Native Application

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Build a React Native mobile application that functions as an intelligent product recommendation system. Users input natural language queries describing their needs, and the app leverages AI to analyze the request against a product catalog and provide personalized recommendations with explanations.

**Business Context**: Move beyond traditional keyword-based search to create an intuitive, conversational product discovery experience. The app should understand context, preferences, and use cases to deliver relevant product suggestions.

- Structured prompt engineering for consistent product recommendations
- Error handling for API failures and edge cases
- Response parsing and validation

**3. Data Management**
- Efficient handling of the provided product catalog (46 products, 8 categories)
- Local storage for search history and user preferences
- Optimized product filtering and search algorithms
- Caching strategy for AI responses

**4. Performance & UX**
- Loading states and smooth transitions

### Data Flow
1. User enters natural language query
2. Query sent to AI service with product catalog context
3. AI returns structured recommendations with reasoning
4. App displays results with explanations
5. User can view detailed product information
6. Search history stored locally

## AI Integration Approach

### Prompt Engineering Strategy
```
System Context: You are an AI product advisor. Analyze the user's query and recommend the most suitable products from the provided catalog.

User Query: [USER_INPUT]
Product Catalog: [PRODUCTS_JSON]

Requirements:
1. Return exactly 3-5 product recommendations
2. Include reasoning for each recommendation
3. Consider price, features, category, and use case
4. Format response as structured JSON

Response Format:
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "product_id": "index",
      "relevance_score": 0-100,
      "reasoning": "Why this product matches the query",
      "key_features": ["feature1", "feature2"]
    }
  ],
  "query_analysis": "Brief analysis of what the user is looking for"
}
```

### API Integration Considerations
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper API call throttling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Caching**: Store recent AI responses to reduce API calls
- **Cost Optimization**: Use shorter prompts and efficient token usage
